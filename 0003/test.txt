In this paper, we proposed a new segmentation-based classification
technique for PolSAR data. The proposed RHLBP
operator presents satisfactory performance in extracting discriminative
texture information which guarantee the regional
homogeneity. Moreover, the color features provide useful
information for segmentation-based classification. The comparison
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method for PolSAR image classification. Our experiments
are mainly based on the false color image obtained
from the PolSAR data, which show the potential importance
of the color feature in polarimetric information understanding
and representation.
