Pixel-based classification methods, such as maximum likelihood and ISODATA, only use the backscatter coef-ficient of SAR images, and the rich texture, roughness and other information in images are not applied. The result of classification is not satisfactory. The smallest processing unit of object-oriented classification method in information extraction is no longer the pixel, but the object with more semantic information of adjacent pixels. It classifies the remote sensing images in a higher level in order to reduce the semantic information loss rate as in the traditional pixel-based classification; so that the classification results semantic information will be richer [1].
A lot of scholars from home and abroad have studied the land use and land-cover classification using optical images based on object-oriented technology. The results show the accuracy of classification improves significantly compared with the traditional classification methods [2,3]. There are also many scholars who have studied the object- oriented classification using SAR images. [4,5]. However, the theoretical foundation, model building and other as-pects in this field are less advanced than optical images obviously. This paper tries to conduct the double-polarized SAR image classification based on object-oriented tech-nology, and confirms that the method is also suitable for the high-precision classification of dual-polarized SAR images.
