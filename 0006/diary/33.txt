The object-oriented classification idea is to simulate hu-man cognitive processes. The human brains always put things in a specific environment when analyzing and iden-tifying the things. Environment is vital important for identifying things. Human¡¯s perception of external things is unified, including the color, external contour, spacing and other properties of things. Similarly, in making vis-ual interpretation of remote sensing images, besides the differences between the colors, it can identify the ground objects by texture, shape, adjacency relationships etc. The object-oriented classification method extracts the homogeneous regions before classifying. The specific two-step process is multi-scale segmentation and classification.
