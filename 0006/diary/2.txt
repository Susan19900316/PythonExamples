SAR has great significance because of its imaging capa-bility in all day and all weather which could make up for the weakness of optical remote sensing in the application of land use and dynamic monitoring in cloudy and rainy areas. Electromagnetic waves are sensitive to the shape, size, texture, surface roughness, the complex permittivity of ground objects. Compared with single-Polarization, dual polarization is more sensitive to the properties of the ground objects and it¡¯s more suitable for ground objects¡¯ recognition and land use classification.
Traditional information extraction technology with sin-gle a pixel as a unit emphasizes too much on part (color and texture of a single pixel), while ignores the geomet-ric structure of whole map spot nearby.
Pixel-oriented solution model analyze pixel separately which has low interpretation accuracy.
